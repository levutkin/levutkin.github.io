	depend on the working state of the other components in the system
	or on changeable conditions of system functioning. A special type
	of load, namely the piecewise constant load is investigated. The
	main assumption used in the paper is the so-called `condition of
	the residual lifetime conservation' of the system, which is equivalent
	to the condition of continuity of the reliability (survivor) function.
	Rather simple recurrent expressions are obtained for computing reliability

	Abstract = {New methods of reliability analysis by limited and incomplete information
	about the component reliability are studied. The methods are based
	on usage the imprecise probability theory. There is complete information
	about reliability of a system and its components if (i) a system
	structure is known; (ii) the precise probability component lifetime
	distributions are known; (iii) there is information about independence
	of the system components. It is shown that the reliability analysis
	problems can be reduced to special optimization problems that are
	linear for some important special cases. The present methods allow
	us to use only available information without additional assumption
	that may be incorrect. New lifetime distribution classes are introduced.
	These classes generalize the well-known increasing and decreasing
	failure rate distributions and can represent various quantitative
	and qualitative judgements related to lifetime distributions. The
	statistical inference procedure for computing the parameters of classes
	from sample data is proposed. A lot of examples illustrate new methods.

	the reliability and safety analysis and prediction.},

	To take into account the above problems, some new flexible lifetime
	distribution classes H(r,s) are introduced. The proposed distribution
	classes generalize the known IFRA and DFRA classes and can cover
	a wide variety of kinds of partial and precise reliability information.
	An efficient statistical method is developed for calculating parameters

	Abstract = {In processing expert judgements, it is common to assign experts' opinions
	different degree of plausibility or probability. This results in
	constructing some kind of hierarchical model. Hierarchical models
	are widely used in Bayesian inference. Several models have been proposed
	by the adherents of imprecise statistical reasoning. This paper describes
	a new hierarchical uncertainty model of a more general form: first-
	and second-order uncertainty models are both imprecise. We demonstrate
	that depending on what kind of evidence the modeller has at hand
	and the reliability quantifying the quality of expert judgement one
	comes to different rules of combination. It is shown that the rules
	of combination known in imprecise statistical reasoning can be inferred
	from the approach proposed in the paper. We describe how the model
	can be used to generate first-order coherent interval-valued previsions.
	One of the other particularities of this paper is the use of the
	natural extension in its ''primal'' and ''dual'' form which we consider
	a very constructive tool for some applications.},

	of the occurrence of this event multiplied by the consequences. It
	very often happens that the probability distributions cannot be determined

	fundamental reasons, such as insufficient available information.
	Therefore, it is proposed in the paper an approach for risk analysis

	For example, there is a comparative judgement such as ''The component
	A failure before time instant 10 hours is at least as probable as
	the component B failure before time instant 20 hours''. Note that
	we do not know about the specified component lifetime distributions

	judgements and to make maximal use of the available information without

	be employed. The reliability analysis in this case is reduced to

	Abstract = {In practice, it is not likely that enough data about the failure or
	repair behavior can be collected to correctly use the probability
	measure for reliability analyzing. Moreover, in some cases, the information
	we have about the functioning of components and systems is not based
	on statistics, but is of a linguistic nature, i.e. the information
	is conveyed by statements in natural language. Very often the reliability
	of the system is presented in a form of the mean time to failure
	(MTTF) or comparative MTTF. In order to use this reliability measure
	for future computations the new models have to be developed. A theory
	of imprecise probabilities might be a basis for reliability analyzing
	when we have such the incomplete information about reliability behavior
	of the system. The paper may be viewed as an attempt to generalize
	the classical reliability theory based on the probabilistic models
	and to study the basic properties and advantages of the new reliability
	models.},

	Abstract = {The natural extension, the key concept for the construction of coherent
	imprecise models, can appear in different equivalent forms. Each
	of them has pros and cons in the context of specific applications.
	The use of a proper form can substantially facilitate the inference
	and computation of the previsions of interest. The current paper
	concerns four forms of the natural extension representation. It is
	demonstrated that all of them are equivalent and one, discussed in
	the last instance, is prominent solely for gambles defined on continuous
	possibility sets. It is proven that the solution of the natural extension
	problem for continuous gambles exists on the degenerate distributions.
	Partial information and a characteristic to be calculated can be
	thought as the expectations of some real-valued functions defined
	on the possibility space. As they are expectations, they can be expressed
	as functions of probability density functions and proper real-valued
	functions (gambles). Each piece of the partial information acts as
	a constraint to the probability distributions. All together the constraints
	define the area of all distributions over which the interval of the
	desired statistical characteristic will be searched. Throughout the
	paper the natural extension is analyzed through the prism of reliability
	application.},

	in the current paper are grounded on partial information on system
	components. A tool for inferring the intervals is the natural extension
	and the upper and lower bounds of the characteristics to be interpreted
	as coherent upper and lower previsions. A generic algorithm to find
	a solution of the natural extension in a practically affordable way
	braking down the general problem into problems that are much easier
	to solve is described. In general this can be made at the cost of
	a lesser precision in the previsions of interest. It is also shown
	that for some particular cases the genuine, minimally coherent, solutions
	can be found through the algorithm developed. The second part of
	the paper is devoted to those cases when the reliability of components
	constituting a system is represented by identical interval-valued
	reliability characteristics. That is, all the components are characterized,
	for example, by probabilities to failure in the same time interval,
	or by mean times to failure or some others. Often namely these particular

	based on variants of the original AdaBoost algorithm are proposed.
	The generalization of these regression methods consists in restricting
	the unit simplex for the weights of the instances to a smaller set
	of weighting probabilities. Various imprecise statistical models
	can be used to obtain a restricted set of weighting probabilities,
	whose sizes each depend on a single parameter. For particular choices
	of this parameter, the proposed algorithms reduce to standard AdaBoost-based
	regression algorithms or to standard regression. The main advantage
	of the proposed algorithms compared to the basic AdaBoost-based regression
	methods is that they have less tendency to over-fitting, because
	the weights of the hard instances are restricted. Several simulations
	and applications furthermore indicate a better performance of the
	proposed regression methods in comparison with the corresponding

	Abstract = {A framework for constructing robust classification models is proposed
	in the paper. An assumption about importance of one of the classes
	in comparison with other classes is incorporated into the models.
	It often takes place in the real application, for example, in reliability,
	in medical diagnostic, etc. A main idea underlying the models is
	to consider a set of probability distributions on training examples
	produced by the imprecise probability models such as linear-vacuous
	mixture and constant odd-ratio contaminated models. Extreme points
	of the sets of probability distributions are a main tool for constructing
	the robust classifiers. It is shown that algorithms for computing
	optimal classification parameters are reduced to a finite number
	of weighted support vector machines with weights determined by the
	extreme points. Experimental results with synthetic and real data
	illustrate the proposed models.},

	Abstract = {When it is difficult to get learning data during the training time,
	we have to classify objects by having extremely small information
	about their feature. It is assumed in the paper that only some average
	or mean value of every feature and the lower and upper bounds of
	a set of its values are known. The main idea for constructing new
	classification models taking into account this information is to
	form a set of probability distributions bounded by some lower and
	upper probability distribution functions (a p-box). A discriminant
	function is derived in order to maximise the risk measure over the
	set of distributions and to minimise it over a set of classification
	parameters. The algorithm for classification is reduced to a parametric
	linear programming problem.},

	Abstract = {The imprecise voting multi-criteria decision problem depends on the
	way for combining the judgments of experts or a decision maker. Modifications
	of the DS/AHP method (Dempster-Shafer theory/analytic hierarchy process)
	are studied in the paper. These modifications use groups of experts
	or decision makers for comparing decision alternatives and criteria
	and they do not require assigning favourability values for groups
	of decision alternatives and criteria. Two ways are proposed for
	combining the expert judgments. The first way uses the extended total
	probability theorem for dealing with conditional basic probability
	assignments. The second way considers every criterion as an unreliable
	source of evidence and uses Dempster's combination rule. Moreover,
	the imprecise Dirichlet model is applied to the modifications for
	making cautious decision. Numerical examples explain and illustrate
	the proposed modifications.},
