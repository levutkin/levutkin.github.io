When considered as covariates, the large number of variables ({SNP}s) and their association with those in close proximity pose challenges for variable selection. The features of sparsity and shrinkage of regression coefficients of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method appear attractive for {SNP} selection. Sparse partial least squares (SPLS) is also appealing as it combines the features of sparsity in subset selection and dimension reduction to handle correlations among {SNP}s. In this paper, we investigate application of the LASSO and SPLS methods for selecting {SNP}s that predict quantitative traits. We evaluate the performance of both methods with different criteria and under different scenarios using simulation studies. Results indicate that these methods can be effective in selecting {SNP}s that predict quantitative traits but are limited by some conditions. Both methods perform similarly overall but each exhibit advantages over the other in given situations. Both methods are applied to Canadian Holstein cattle data to compare their performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The last decade of human genetic research witnessed the completion of hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, the genetic variants discovered through these efforts account for only a small proportion of the heritability of complex traits. One explanation for the missing heritability is that the common analysis approach, assessing the effect of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually, is not well suited to the detection of small effects of multiple SNPs. Gene set analysis (GSA) is one of several approaches that may contribute to the discovery of additional genetic risk factors for complex traits. Complex phenotypes are thought to be controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of sets of genes. By assessing the overall evidence of association of a phenotype with all measured variation in a set of genes, GSA may identify functionally relevant sets of genes corresponding to relevant biomolecular pathways, which will enable more focused studies of genetic risk factors. This approach may thus contribute to the discovery of genetic variants responsible for some of the missing heritability. With the increased use of these approaches for the secondary analysis of data from GWAS, it is important to understand the different GSA methods and their strengths and weaknesses, and consider challenges inherent in these types of analyses. This paper provides an overview of GSA, highlighting the key challenges, potential solutions, and directions for ongoing research.},

Motivated by the need of ongoing efforts to develop targeted agents for lung cancer patients, we propose a Bayesian two-step Lasso procedure for biomarker selection under the proportional hazards model. We seek to identify the key markers that are either prognostic or predictive with respect to treatment from a large number of biomarkers. In the first step of our two-step strategy, we use the Bayesian group Lasso to identify the important marker groups, wherein each group contains the main effect of a single marker and its interactions with treatments. Applying a loose selection criterion in the first step, the goal of first step is to screen out unimportant biomarkers. In the second step, we zoom in to select the individual markers and interactions between markers and treatments in order to identify prognostic or predictive markers using the Bayesian adaptive Lasso. Our strategy takes a full Bayesian approach and is built upon rapid advancement of Lasso methodologies with variable selection. The proposed method is generally applicable to the development of targeted therapies in clinical trials. Our simulation study demonstrates the good performance of the two-step Lasso: Important biomarkers can typically be selected with high probabilities, and unimportant markers can be effectively eliminated from the model.},

Population structure causes false positive associations in GWAS if not accounted for, and methods to deal with this are presented.

Given this genetic architecture, gains from marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs using only a small number of DNA markers to trace a limited number of QTL is likely to be small. This has lead to the development of alternative technology for using the available dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information, called genomic selection. Genomic selection uses a genome-wide panel of dense markers so that all QTL are likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with at least one SNP. The genomic breeding values are predicted to be the sum of the effect of these SNPs across the entire genome. In dairy cattle breeding, the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) that can be achieved and the fact that these are available early in life have lead to rapid adoption of the technology. Here, we discuss the design of experiments necessary to achieve accurate prediction of GEBV in future generations in terms of the number of markers necessary and the size of the reference population where marker effects are estimated. We also present a simple method for implementing genomic selection using a genomic relationship matrix. Future challenges discussed include using whole genome sequence data to improve the accuracy of genomic selection and management of inbreeding through genomic relationships.}

  Abstract                 = {Testing one SNP at a time does not fully realise the potential of genome-wide association studies to identify multiple causal variants, which is a plausible scenario for many complex diseases. We show that simultaneous analysis of the entire set of SNPs from a genome-wide study to identify the subset that best predicts disease outcome is now feasible, thanks to developments in stochastic search methods. We used a Bayesian-inspired penalised maximum likelihood approach in which every SNP can be considered for additive, dominant, and recessive contributions to disease risk. Posterior mode estimates were obtained for regression coefficients that were each assigned a prior with a sharp mode at zero. A non-zero coefficient estimate was interpreted as corresponding to a significant SNP. We investigated two prior distributions and show that the normal-exponential-gamma prior leads to improved SNP selection in comparison with single-SNP tests. We also derived an explicit approximation for type-I error that avoids the need to use permutation procedures. As well as genome-wide analyses, our method is well-suited to fine mapping with very dense SNP sets obtained from re-sequencing and/or imputation. It can accommodate quantitative as well as case-control phenotypes, covariate adjustment, and can be extended to search for interactions. Here, we demonstrate the power and empirical type-I error of our approach using simulated case-control data sets of up to 500 K SNPs, a real genome-wide data set of 300 K SNPs, and a sequence-based dataset, each of which can be analysed in a few hours on a desktop workstation.},

Our comparison study shows several interesting facts and provides the biologists and the biostatisticians some insights into the classification tools in microarray data analysis. This study also shows that the more sophisticated classifiers give better performances than classical methods such as kNN, DLDA, DQDA and the choice of gene selection method has much effect on the performance of the classification methods, and thus the classification methods should be considered together with the gene selection criteria.}

It is desirable that gene selection can improve classification performance of learning algorithm effectively. In general, for most gene selection methods widely used in reality, an individual gene subset will be chosen according to its discriminative power. One of deficiencies of individual gene subset is that its contribution to classification purpose is limited. This issue can be alleviated by ensemble gene selection based on random selection to some extend. However, the random one requires an unnecessary large number of candidate gene subsets and its reliability is a problem. In this study, we propose a new ensemble method, called ensemble gene selection by grouping (EGSG), to select multiple gene subsets for the classification purpose. Rather than selecting randomly, our method chooses salient gene subsets from microarray data by virtue of information theory and approximate Markov blanket. The effectiveness and accuracy of our method is validated by experiments on five publicly available microarray data sets. The experimental results show that our ensemble gene selection method has comparable classification performance to other gene selection methods, and is more stable than the random one.}

Its accurate prediction to the type or size of tumors relies on adopting powerful and reliable classification models, so as to patients can be provided with better treatment or response to therapy. However, the high dimensionality of microarray data may bring some disadvantages, such as over-fitting, poor performance and low efficiency, to traditional classification models. Thus, one of the challenging tasks in cancer diagnosis is how to identify salient expression genes from thousands of genes in microarray data that can directly contribute to the phenotype or symptom of disease. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble gene selection method (EGS) to choose multiple gene subsets for classification purpose, where the significant degree of gene is measured by conditional mutual information or its normalized form. After different gene subsets have been obtained by setting different starting points of the search procedure, they will be used to train multiple base classifiers and then aggregated into a consensus classifier by the manner of majority voting. The proposed method is compared with five popular gene selection methods on six public microarray datasets and the comparison results show that our method works well.}

Motivated by the fact that there exists natural grouping structure in single nucleotide polymorphisms and, more importantly, such groups are correlated, we propose a new penalization method for group variable selection which can properly accommodate the correlation between adjacent groups. This method is based on a combination of the group Lasso penalty and a quadratic penalty on the difference of regression coefficients of adjacent groups. The new method is referred to as smoothed group Lasso (SGL). It encourages group sparsity and smoothes regression coefficients for adjacent groups. Canonical correlations are applied to the weights between groups in the quadratic difference penalty. We first derive a GCD algorithm for computing the solution path with linear regression model. The SGL method is further extended to logistic regression for binary response. With the assistance of the majorize-minimization algorithm, the SGL penalized logistic regression turns out to be an iteratively penalized least-square problem. We also suggest conducting principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality within groups. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the finite sample performance. Comparison with group Lasso shows that SGL is more effective in selecting true positives. Two datasets are analyzed using the SGL method. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection is commonly performed by analysis of designed segregating populations derived from two inbred parental lines, where absence of selection, mutation and genetic drift is assumed. Even for designed populations, selection cannot always be avoided, with as consequence varying correlation between genotypes instead of uniform correlation. Akin to linkage disequilibrium mapping, ignoring this type of genetic relatedness will increase the rate of false-positives. In this paper, we advocate using mixed models including genetic relatedness, or ‘kinship’ information for QTL detection in populations where selection forces operated. We demonstrate our case with a three-way barley cross, designed to segregate for dwarfing, vernalization and spike morphology genes, in which selection occurred. The population of 161 inbred lines was screened with 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and used for gene and QTL detection. The coefficient of coancestry matrix was estimated based on the SNPs and imposed to structure the distribution of random genotypic effects. The model incorporating kinship, coancestry, information was consistently superior to the one without kinship (according to the Akaike information criterion). We show, for three traits, that ignoring the coancestry information results in an unrealistically high number of marker–trait associations, without providing clear conclusions about QTL locations. We used a number of widely recognized dwarfing and vernalization genes known to segregate in the studied population as landmarks or references to assess the agreement of the mapping results with a priori candidate gene expectations. Additional QTLs to the major genes were detected for all traits as well.},

However, the BL relies on a single parameter known as the regularization parameter to simultaneously control the overall model sparsity and the shrinkage of individual covariate effects. This may be idealistic when dealing with a large number of predictors whose effect sizes may differ by orders of magnitude. Here we propose the extended Bayesian LASSO (EBL) for QTL mapping and unobserved phenotype prediction, which introduces an additional level to the hierarchical specification of the BL to explicitly separate out these two model features. Compared to the adaptiveness of the BL, the EBL is “doubly adaptive” and thus, more robust to tuning. In simulations, the EBL outperformed the BL in regard to the accuracy of both effect size estimates and phenotypic value predictions, with comparable computational time. Moreover, the EBL proved to be less sensitive to tuning than the related Bayesian adaptive LASSO (BAL), which introduces locus-specific regularization parameters as well, but involves no mechanism for distinguishing between model sparsity and parameter shrinkage. Consequently, the EBL seems to point to a new direction for QTL mapping, phenotype prediction, and GBV estimation.},

With the evolution of SNP marker genotyping technology and the consequent cost reduction for genotyping thousands of SNP markers{,} significant research effort is being undertaken in the statistics and machine learning community to perform efficient analysis of these multidimensional datasets. For large plant breeding programs{,} besides identifying biomarkers associated with disease resistance{,} developing accurate predictive models of the phenotype based on the genotype alone is one of the most relevant scientific goals{,} as it allows for efficient selection without having to grow and phenotype every individual. While the importance of interactions for understanding diseases has been shown in many studies{,} the majority of the existing methods are limited by considering each biomarker as an independent variable{,} completely ignoring complex interactions among biomarkers. In this study{,} logistic regression p-value{,} Pearson correlation and mutual information were calculated for all two-way SNP interactions with respect to the Grey Leaf Spot (GLS) disease resistance phenotype. These interactions were subsequently ranked based on these measures and the performance of the LASSO algorithm for GLS disease resistance prediction was then shown to be maximized by adding the top 10 000 two-way interactions from the logistic regression p-value based rank. The logistic regression p-value based rank also led to an error rate of more than 3 percentual points lower than not adding any interaction and more than 3.5 percentual points lower than adding interactions chosen at random.},

However, high dimensionality and a small number of noisy samples pose significant challenges to existing classification methods. Focused on the problems of overfitting and sensitivity to noise of the dataset in the classification of microarray data, we propose an interval-valued analysis method based on a rough set technique to select discriminative genes and to use these genes to classify tissue samples of microarray data. We first select a small subset of genes based on interval-valued rough set by considering the preference-ordered domains of the gene expression data, and then classify test samples into certain classes with a term of similar degree. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to reach high prediction accuracies with a small number of selected genes and its performance is robust to noise.}

  Abstract                 = {Estimation of narrow-sense heritability, h2, from genome-wide SNPs genotyped in unrelated individuals has recently attracted interest and offers several advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods. With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the 300,000 SNPs on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5%–10% can be explained by SNPs reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in SNP-based h2 estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs: contributions to h2 are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h2 estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises downward the h2 estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high LD in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for computing LD-adjusted kinships.},

The objectives of the study presented in this paper are to identify a subset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that are associated with a particular trait and to construct a model that can best predict the value of the trait given the genotypic information of the SNPs using a three-step strategy. In the first step, a genome-wide association test is performed to screen SNPs that are associated with the quantitative trait of interest. SNPs with p-values of less than 5% are then analyzed in the second step. In the second step, a large number of randomly selected models, each consisting of a fixed number of randomly selected SNPs, are analyzed using the least angle regression method. This step will further remove redundant SNPs due to the complicated association among SNPs. A subset of SNPs that are shown to have a significant effect on the response trait more often than by chance are considered for the third step. In the third step, two alternative methods are considered: the least angle shrinkage and selection operation and sparse partial least squares regression. For both methods, the predictive ability of the fitted model is evaluated by an independent test set. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by the analysis of a real data set on Canadian Holstein cattle.},

genome-wide molecular marker information. However, issues of high dimensionality, multicollinearity, and the inability to
deal effectively with epistasis can jeopardize accuracy and predictive ability. We, therefore, propose a new nonparametric
method, pRKHS, which combines the features of supervised principal component analysis (SPCA) and reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression, with versions for traits with no/low epistasis, pRKHS-NE, to high epistasis, pRKHS-E. Instead
of assigning a specific relationship to represent the underlying epistasis, the method maps genotype to phenotype in a
nonparametric way, thus requiring fewer genetic assumptions. SPCA decreases the number of markers needed for
prediction by filtering out low-signal markers with the optimal marker set determined by cross-validation. Principal
components are computed from reduced marker matrix (called supervised principal components, SPC) and included in the
smoothing spline ANOVA model as independent variables to fit the data. The new method was evaluated in comparison
with current popular methods for practicing GS, specifically RR-BLUP, BayesA, BayesB, as well as a newer method by Crossa
et al., RKHS-M, using both simulated and real data. Results demonstrate that pRKHS generally delivers greater predictive
ability, particularly when epistasis impacts trait expression. Beyond prediction, the new method also facilitates inferences
about the extent to which epistasis influences trait expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate genetic prediction of quantitative traits related to complex disease risk would have potential clinical
impact, so investigation of statistical methodology to improve predictive performance is important. We compare a simple
approach of polygenic scores using top ranking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to a set of shrinkage models, namely
Ridge Regression, Lasso and Hyper-Lasso. These penalised regression methods analyse all genotyped SNPs simultaneously,
potentially including much larger sets of SNPs in the models, not only those with the smallest P values. We compare the
accuracy of these models for predicting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, two
lipid traits of clinical relevance, in the Whitehall II and British Women’s Health and Heart Study cohorts, using SNPs
from the HumanCVD BeadChip. For gene scores, the most accurate predictions arise from multivariate weighted scores and
include only a small number of SNPs, identified as top hits by the HumanCVD BeadChip. Furthermore, there was little
benefit from including external results from published sets of SNPs. We found that shrinkage approaches rarely improved
significantly on gene score results. Genetic predictive performance is trait specific, depending on the heritability and genetic
architecture of the trait, and is limited by the training data sample size. Our results for lipid traits suggest no current benefit
of more complex methods over existing gene score methods. Instead, the most important choice for the prediction model is
the number of SNPs and selection of the most predictive SNPs to include. However further comparisons, in larger samples
and for other phenotypes, would still be of interest.},

The first stage for this kind of classification methods is to select a pre-specified number of genes, which are likely to be the most relevant to the occurrence of a disease, and passes these genes to the second stage for classification. In this paper, we use four gene selection mechanisms and two classification tools to compose eight two-stage classification methods, and test these eight methods on eight microarray data sets for analyzing their performance. The first interesting finding is that the genes chosen by different categories of gene selection mechanisms are less than half in common but result in insignificantly different classification accuracies. A subset-gene-ranking mechanism can be beneficial in classification accuracy, but its computational effort is much heavier. Whether the classification tool employed at the second stage should be accompanied with a dimension reduction technique depends on the characteristics of a data set.}

A simple random sampling method in random forest using default mtry parameter to choose feature subspace, will select too many subspaces without informative SNPs. Exhaustive searching an optimal mtry is often required in order to include useful and relevant SNPs and get rid of vast of non-informative SNPs. However, it is very time-consuming and not favorable in GWA study for high dimensional data. This paper proposes a stratified sampling method for feature subspace selection to generate decision trees in a random forest for GWA high-dimensional data. We employ two genome-wide SNP data sets (Parkinson case control data comprised of 408,803 SNPs and Alzheimer case control data comprised of 380,157 SNPs) to demonstrate that the proposed stratified sampling method is effective, and it can generate better random forest with higher accuracy and lower error bound than those by Breiman's random forest generation method.},

Typically, a large number of marker effects are estimated from a small number of animals, which presents an under-determined problem. In this paper, we propose sparse marker selection methods using haplotypes for both breeding value estimation and QTL mapping. By applying a two-stage regression strategy, markers are selected in the first stage, then in the second stage the selected markers are fitted in a range of models including linear, kernel and semi-parametric models. The estimation accuracy of breeding values is measured by the correlation coefficient, as well as the regression coefficient, between the true breeding values and the estimated breeding values by the models. We show that the estimation accuracy by using sparse markers, as low as 5000 or 500 dimensions, is comparable to that obtained from genome wide markers of about 230,000 dimensions of DNA haplotypes. The selected sparse markers can also be used for QTL mapping. In this paper we use protein yield to demonstrate the methods, and show that loci of large effects confirm published QTL.},

Results
We develop a novel multivariate algorithm for large scale SNP selection using CAR score regression, a promising new approach for prioritizing biomarkers. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for shrinkage estimation of CAR scores from high-dimensional data. Subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive comparison study including five advanced regression approaches (boosting, lasso, NEG, MCP, and CAR score) and a univariate approach (marginal correlation) to determine the effectiveness in finding true causal SNPs.},
