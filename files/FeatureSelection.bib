	abstract = {Consider using values of variables X 1, X 2,â€¦, X p to classify entities into one of two classes. Kernel-based procedures such as support vector machines (SVMs) are well suited for this task. In general, the classification accuracy of SVMs can be substantially improved if instead of all p candidate variables, a smaller subset of (say m) variables is used. A new two-step approach to variable selection for SVMs is therefore proposed: best variable subsets of size kÂ =Â 1,2,â€¦, p are first identified, and then a new data-dependent criterion is used to determine a value for m. The new approach is evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation study, and on a sample of data sets.},

@article{Javed-Babri-Saeed-12,
	abstract = {Data and knowledge management systems employ feature selection algorithms for removing irrelevant, redundant, and noisy information from the data. There are two well-known approaches to feature selection, feature ranking (FR) and feature subset selection (FSS). In this paper, we propose a new FR algorithm, termed as class-dependent density-based feature elimination (CDFE), for binary data sets. Our theoretical analysis shows that CDFE computes the weights, used for feature ranking, more efficiently as compared to the mutual information measure. Effectively, rankings obtained from both the two criteria approximate each other. CDFE uses a filtrapper approach to select a final subset. For data sets having hundreds of thousands of features, feature selection with FR algorithms is simple and computationally efficient but redundant information may not be removed. On the other hand, FSS algorithms analyze the data for redundancies but may become computationally impractical on high-dimensional data sets. We address these problems by combining FR and FSS methods in the form of a two-stage feature selection algorithm. When introduced as a preprocessing step to the FSS algorithms, CDFE not only presents them with a feature subset, good in terms of classification, but also relieves them from heavy computations. Two FSS algorithms are employed in the second stage to test the two-stage feature selection idea. We carry out experiments with two different classifiers (naive Bayes' and kernel ridge regression) on three different real-life data sets (NOVA, HIVA, and GINA) of the ''Agnostic Learning versus Prior Knowledge'' challenge. As a stand-alone method, CDFE shows up to about 92 percent reduction in the feature set size. When combined with the FSS algorithms in two-stages, CDFE significantly improves their classification accuracy and exhibits up to 97 percent reduction in the feature set size. We also compared CDFE against the winning entries of the challenge and found that it outperforms the best results on NOVA and HIVA while obtaining a third position in case of GINA.},

probability, and each pair of votes correlateswith the same correlation coefficient, there
exists a correlation-robust voting quota, such that the probability of a correct verdict is
independent of the correlation coefficient. For positive correlation, an increase in the
correlation coefficient decreases the probability of a correct verdict for any voting rule
below the correlation-robust quota, and increases that probability for any above the
correlation-robust quota. The jury may be less competent under the correlation-robust
rule than under simple majority rule and less competent under simple majority rule
than a single juror alone. The jury is always less competent than a single juror under

	abstract = {Feature selection methods play a significant role during classification of data having high dimensions of features. The
methods select most relevant subset of features that describe data appropriately. Mutual information (MI) based upon
information theory is one of the metrics used for measuring relevance of features. This paper analyses various feature
selection methods for (1) reduction in number of features; (2) performance of Naive Bayes classification model trained
on reduced set of features. Research gaps identified are: (1) computation of MI from the whole sample space instead of
unclassified sample subspace; (2) consideration of relevance of features only or tradeoff between relevance and redundancy,
but class conditional interaction of features is ignored.
In this paper, we propose a general evaluation function using MI for feature selection. The proposed evaluation function
is implemented which use dynamically computed MI values from unclassified instances. Effectiveness of the proposed
feature selection method is done empirically by comparing classification results using KDD 1999 benchmarked dataset of
intrusion detection. The results indicate practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method for applications concerned
with high accuracy and stability of predictions.},

problem. Based on the current framework of sophisticated feature selection methods, we identify
features that contain the most relevant information to distinguish good loan payers from
bad loan payers. The feature selection methods are validated on several real world datasets
with different types of classifiers. We show the advantages following from using the sub-space
approach to classification. We discuss many practical issues related to the applicability of
feature selection methods. We show and discuss some difficulties that use to be insufficiently
emphasised in standard feature selection literature.},

	abstract = {Feature selection aims at finding a feature subset that has the most discriminative information from the original feature set. In this paper, we firstly present a new scheme for feature relevance, interdependence and redundancy analysis using information theoretic criteria. Then, a dynamic weighting-based feature selection algorithm is proposed, which not only selects the most relevant features and eliminates redundant features, but also tries to retain useful intrinsic groups of interdependent features. The primary characteristic of the method is that the feature is weighted according to its interaction with the selected features. And the weight of features will be dynamically updated after each candidate feature has been selected. To verify the effectiveness of our method, experimental comparisons on six UCI data sets and four gene microarray datasets are carried out using three typical classifiers. The results indicate that our proposed method achieves promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},
