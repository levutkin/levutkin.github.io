However, their use in reliability applications has not been widely explored. In this paper, a comparative analysis is presented in order to evaluate the \{SVM\} effectiveness in forecasting time-to-failure and reliability of engineered components based on time series data. The performance on literature case studies of \{SVM\} regression is measured against other advanced learning methods such as the Radial Basis Function, the traditional MultiLayer Perceptron model, Box-Jenkins autoregressive-integrated-moving average and the Infinite Impulse Response Locally Recurrent Neural Networks. The comparison shows that in the analyzed cases, \{SVM\} outperforms or is comparable to other techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Software reliability models are used to estimate the probability that a software fails at a given time. They are fundamental to plan test activities, and to ensure the quality of the software being developed. Each project has a different reliability growth behavior, and although several different models have been proposed to estimate the reliability growth, none has proven to perform well considering different project characteristics. Because of this, some authors have introduced the use of Machine Learning techniques, such as neural networks, to obtain software reliability models. Neural network-based models, however, are not easily interpreted, and other techniques could be explored. In this paper, we explore an approach based on genetic programming, and also propose the use of boosting techniques to improve performance. We conduct experiments with reliability models based on time, and on test coverage. The obtained results show some advantages of the introduced approach. The models adapt better to the reliability curve, and can be used in projects with different characteristics.}

  abstract  = {Research problem The impact of failures on software systems can be substantial since the recovery process can require unexpected amounts of time and resources. Accurate failure predictions can help in mitigating the impact of failures. Resources, applications, and services can be scheduled to limit the impact of failures. However, providing accurate predictions sufficiently ahead is challenging. Log files contain messages that represent a change of system state. A sequence or a pattern of messages may be used to predict failures. Contribution We describe an approach to predict failures based on log files using Random Indexing (RI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Method \{RI\} is applied to represent sequences: each operation is characterized in terms of its context. \{SVMs\} associate sequences to a class of failures or non-failures. Weighted \{SVMs\} are applied to deal with imbalanced datasets and to improve the true positive rate. We apply our approach to log files collected during approximately three months of work in a large European manufacturing company. Results According to our results, weighted \{SVMs\} sacrifice some specificity to improve sensitivity. Specificity remains higher than 0.80 in four out of six analyzed applications. Conclusions Overall, our approach is very reliable in predicting both failures and non-failures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software reliability prediction plays a very important role in the analysis of software quality and balance of software cost. The data during software lifecycle is used to analyze and predict software reliability. However, predicting the variability of software reliability with time is very difficult. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been widely applied to solve nonlinear predicting problems in many fields and has obtained good performance in many situations; however it is still difficult to optimize SVR's parameters. Previously, some optimization algorithms have been used to find better parameters of SVR, but these existing algorithms usually are not fully satisfactory. In this paper, we first improve estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) in order to maintain the diversity of the population, and then a hybrid improved estimation of distribution algorithms (IEDA) and \{SVR\} model, called IEDA-SVR model, is proposed. \{IEDA\} is used to optimize parameters of SVR, and IEDA-SVR model is used to predict software reliability. We compare IEDA-SVR model with other software reliability models using real software failure datasets. The experimental results show that the IEDA-SVR model has better prediction performance than the other models.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In this paper, we propose an effective approach to estimate the parameters of software reliability growth model (SRGM) using a real-valued genetic algorithm (RGA). The existing \{SRGMs\} require the estimation of the parameters such as the total number of failures or the failure detection rate using numerical methods, maximum likelihood estimation or least square estimation. However, these methods impose certain constraints on the parameter estimation of \{SRGM\} like requiring the continuity and existence of derivatives in the modelling function. \{RGA\} is free from the constraints on the parameter estimation of SRGM. Moreover, it is more adapted in optimization of continuous domain such as parameter estimation of \{SRGM\} than a binary genetic algorithm. Two real-valued genetic operators, heuristic crossover and non-uniform mutation, are applied to improve the accuracy and performance of the parameter estimation of SRGM. We conducted experiments on eight real world datasets for comparing the proposed approach with the numerical methods and other existing genetic algorithms. The results indicate that the \{RGA\} is more effective in the parameter estimation of \{SRGM\} than other \{GA\} approaches. We believe that \{RGA\} can be a promising solution to effectively managing software quality through the accurate reliability estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {It has become inevitable for every software developer to understand, to follow that how and why software fails, and to express reliability in quantitative terms. This has led to a proliferation of software reliability models to estimate and predict reliability. The basic approach is to model past failure data to predict future behavior. Most of the models have three major components: assumptions, factors and a mathematical function, usually high order exponential or logarithmic used to relate factors to reliability. Software reliability models are used to forecast the curve of failure rate by statistical evidence available during testing phase. They also can indicate about the extra time required to carry out the test procedure in order to meet the specifications and deliver desired functionality with minimum number of defects. Therefore there are challenges whether, autonomous or machine learning techniques like other predictive methods could be able to forecast the reliability measures for a specific software application. This chapter contemplates reliability issue through a generic Machine Learning paradigm while referring the most common aspects of Support Vector Machine scenario. Couples of customized simulation and experimental results have been presented to support the proposed reliability measures and strategies.},
