  volume = {25},
  pages = {2151-2159},

  abstract = {Approximation methods such as response surface method and artificial
	neural network (ANN) method are widely used to alleviate the computation
	costs in structural reliability analysis. However most of the ANN
	methods proposed in the literature suffer various drawbacks such
	as poor choice of parameter setting, poor generalization and local
	minimum. In this study, a support vector machine-based radial basis
	function (RBF) network method is proposed, in which the improved
	RBF model is used to approximate the limit state function and then
	is connected to a reliability method to estimate failure probability.
	Since the learning algorithm of RBF network is replaced by the support
	vector algorithm, the advantage of the latter, such as good generalization
	ability and global optimization are propagated to the former, thus
	the inherent drawback of RBF network can be defeated. Numerical examples
	are given to demonstrate the applicability of the improved RBF network
	method in structural reliability analysis, as well as to illustrate
	the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  journal = {Structural Safety},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {26},
  pages = {271-293},
  abstract = {The reliability analysis of complex structures is hindered by the
	implicit nature of the limit-state function. For their approximation
	use has been made of the Response Surface Method (RSM) and, more
	recently, of Neural Networks. From the statistical viewpoint this
	corresponds to a regression approach. In the structural reliability
	literature little attention has been paid, however, to the possibility
	of treating the problem as a classification task. This enlarges the
	list of methods that are eventually useful to the purpose at hand
	and justifies an overall examination of their distinguishing features.
	This task is performed in this paper from the point of view of the
	Theory of Statistical Learning, which provides a unified framework
	for all regression, classification and probability density estimation.
	The classification methods are grouped into three categories and
	it is shown that only one group is useful for structural reliability,
	according to some specific criteria. In this category are the Multi-Layer
	Perceptrons and the Support Vector Machines, which are the recommended
	methods because (a) they can estimate the function on the basis of
	a few samples, (b) they use flexible and adaptive models and (c)
	they can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The paper also includes
	an in-depth analysis of the RSM from the point of view of statistical
	learning. It is shown that the empirically found instability of this
	method is explained with statistical learning concepts.},

  year = {2003},
  volume = {129},
  pages = {1141-1149},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {The assessment of the reliability of structural systems is increasingly
	being estimated with regard to the spatial fluctuation of the mechanical
	properties as well as loads. This leads to a detailed probabilistic
	modeling known as stochastic finite elements (SFE). In this paper
	an approach that departs from the main stream of methods for the
	reliability analysis of SFE models is proposed. The difference lies
	in that the reliability problem is treated as a classification task
	and not as the computation of an integral. To this purpose use is
	made of a kernel method for classification, which is the object of
	intensive research in pattern recognition, image analysis, and other
	fields. A greedy sequential procedure requiring a minimal number
	of limit state evaluations is developed. The algorithm is based on
	the key concept of support vectors, which guarantee that only the
	points closest to the decision rule need to be evaluated. The numerical
	examples show that this algorithm allows obtaining a highly accurate
	approximation of the failure probability of SFE models with a minimal
	number of calls of the finite element solver and also a fast computation.},

  volume = {30},
  pages = {132-148},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a study of the parallelization
	of the construction of explicit constraints or limit-state functions
	using support vector machines. These explicit boundaries have proven
	to be beneficial for design optimization and reliability assessment,
	especially for problems with large computational times, discontinuities,
	or binary outputs. In addition to the study of the parallelization,
	the objective of this article is also to provide an approach to select
	the number of processors. Design/methodology/approach - This article
	investigates the parallelization in two ways. First, the efficiency
	of the parallelization is assessed by comparing, over several runs,
	the number of iterations needed to create an accurate boundary to
	the number of iterations associated with a theoretical linear speedup.
	Second, by studying these differences, an appropriate range of parallel
	processors can be inferred. Findings - The parallelization of the
	construction of explicit boundaries can lead to a markedly reduced
	computational burden. The study provides an approach to select the
	number of processors for an optimal use of computational resources.
	Originality/value - The construction of explicit boundaries for design
	optimization and reliability assessment is designed to alleviate
	many hurdles in these areas. The parallelization of the construction
	of the boundaries is a much needed study to reinforce the efficacy
	and efficiency of this approach.},

  abstract = {The response surface method (RSM) is a powerful approach for carrying
	out reliability analysis for complicate engineering with implicit
	limit state functions. The quality of a response surface mainly depends
	on the choice of response surface function and the selection of sample
	points. To investigate the influence of the types of response surface
	functions and to reduce the computation efforts, two new sampling
	methods and a hybrid RSM are proposed. In the hybrid RSM, four types
	of response surface functions and three sampling methods are involved,
	and each Response surface function can be connected to each sampling
	method. The four response surface functions are quadratic polynomial
	without cross terms (PN1), quadratic polynomial with cross terms,
	radial basic function network (RBFN) and support vector machine (SVM).
	The three RSMs using the traditional sampling method, the new iterative
	sampling method and the new experiment design method are RSM1, RSM2
	and RSM3, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of different
	RSMs are illustrated through three examples. When an iterative method
	is used for locating sample points, the PN1-based RSM2 is proposed
	for its accuracy and efficiency. And when an experiment design method
	is used for locating sample points, the RBFN- or SVM-based RSM3 is
	suggested because the RBFN or SVM is suitable for global fitting.},
