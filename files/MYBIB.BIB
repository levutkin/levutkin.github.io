	These classes generalize the well-known increasing and decreasing
	failure rate distributions and can represent various quantitative
	and qualitative judgements related to lifetime distributions. The

	abstract = {In processing expert judgements, it is common to assign experts' opinions
	different degree of plausibility or probability. This results in
	constructing some kind of hierarchical model. Hierarchical models
	are widely used in Bayesian inference. Several models have been proposed
	by the adherents of imprecise statistical reasoning. This paper describes
	a new hierarchical uncertainty model of a more general form: first-
	and second-order uncertainty models are both imprecise. We demonstrate
	that depending on what kind of evidence the modeller has at hand
	and the reliability quantifying the quality of expert judgement one
	comes to different rules of combination. It is shown that the rules
	of combination known in imprecise statistical reasoning can be inferred
	from the approach proposed in the paper. We describe how the model
	can be used to generate first-order coherent interval-valued previsions.
	One of the other particularities of this paper is the use of the
	natural extension in its ''primal'' and ''dual'' form which we consider
	a very constructive tool for some applications.},

	abstract = {The natural extension, the key concept for the construction of coherent
	imprecise models, can appear in different equivalent forms. Each
	of them has pros and cons in the context of specific applications.
	The use of a proper form can substantially facilitate the inference
	and computation of the previsions of interest. The current paper
	concerns four forms of the natural extension representation. It is
	demonstrated that all of them are equivalent and one, discussed in
	the last instance, is prominent solely for gambles defined on continuous
	possibility sets. It is proven that the solution of the natural extension
	problem for continuous gambles exists on the degenerate distributions.
	Partial information and a characteristic to be calculated can be
	thought as the expectations of some real-valued functions defined
	on the possibility space. As they are expectations, they can be expressed
	as functions of probability density functions and proper real-valued
	functions (gambles). Each piece of the partial information acts as
	a constraint to the probability distributions. All together the constraints
	define the area of all distributions over which the interval of the
	desired statistical characteristic will be searched. Throughout the
	paper the natural extension is analyzed through the prism of reliability
	application.},

	constituting a system is represented by identical interval-valued
	reliability characteristics. That is, all the components are characterized,

	The generalization of these regression methods consists in restricting

@article{Utkin-Zhuk12a,
	abstract = {When it is difficult to get learning data during the training time,
	we have to classify objects by having extremely small information
	about their feature. It is assumed in the paper that only some average
	or mean value of every feature and the lower and upper bounds of
	a set of its values are known. The main idea for constructing new
	classification models taking into account this information is to
	form a set of probability distributions bounded by some lower and
	upper probability distribution functions (a p-box). A discriminant
	function is derived in order to maximise the risk measure over the
	set of distributions and to minimise it over a set of classification
	parameters. The algorithm for classification is reduced to a parametric
	linear programming problem.},

	way for combining the judgments of experts or a decision maker. Modifications
	of the DS/AHP method (Dempster-Shafer theory/analytic hierarchy process)
	are studied in the paper. These modifications use groups of experts
	or decision makers for comparing decision alternatives and criteria
	and they do not require assigning favourability values for groups
	of decision alternatives and criteria. Two ways are proposed for
	combining the expert judgments. The first way uses the extended total
	probability theorem for dealing with conditional basic probability
	assignments. The second way considers every criterion as an unreliable
	source of evidence and uses Dempster's combination rule. Moreover,
	the imprecise Dirichlet model is applied to the modifications for
	making cautious decision. Numerical examples explain and illustrate
	the proposed modifications.},
