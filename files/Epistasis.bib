  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The difficulty in elucidating the genetic basis of complex diseases roots in the many factors that can affect the development of a disease. Some of these genetic effects may interact in complex ways, proving undetectable by current single-locus methodology.RESULTS:We have developed an analysis tool called Hypothesis Free Clinical Cloning (HFCC) to search for genome-wide epistasis in a case-control design. HFCC combines a relatively fast computing algorithm for genome-wide epistasis detection, with the flexibility to test a variety of different epistatic models in multi-locus combinations. HFCC has good power to detect multi-locus interactions simulated under a variety of genetic models and noise conditions. Most importantly, HFCC can accomplish exhaustive genome-wide epistasis search with large datasets as demonstrated with a 400,000 SNP set typed on a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients and controls.CONCLUSION:With the current availability of genetic studies with large numbers of individuals and genetic markers, HFCC can have a great impact in the identification of epistatic effects that escape the standard single-locus association analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {Livestock genomics has gone through a paradigm shift since the advent of genome sequencing that includes Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Whole Genome Predictions (WGP) and Genomic Selection (GS). Beginning with a brief review of current progress and challenges in livestock GWAS, WGP and GS, opportunities for next generation methods are introduced that unravel the underlying systems genetics of complex traits and provide biologically meaningful and accurate predictions. Genome-Wide Epistasis Association (GWEA) and Weighted Interaction SNP Hub (WISH) network methods are introduced here to unravel complex trait genetics. These methods effectively address the problems of GWAS that have no ability to model and analyze genome-wide genetic interactions and thus do not capture any epistatic variance that could explain part of the missing heritability. Further, the Systems genomic BLUP (sgBLUP) prediction method is introduced in this paper as a next generation WGP or GS tool that can account for and differentiate SNPs with known biological roles in the phenotypic or disease outcomes and potentially increase the accuracy of prediction. It is emphasized that tools that link genetic variants to their functions, pathways and other biological roles will become even more important in the future. These tools include FunctSNP, Postgwas and NCBI2R which are briefly discussed. Genome-Wide Gene Expression (Transcriptomics) analyses using RNAseq technology are briefly discussed with some examples including results from our own pig experiments. In the last part of this review, systems genetics and systems biology approaches are introduced that involve joint modeling and analyses of multi-omics data types from genomics through transcriptomics (microarray and RNAseq), metabolomics to proteomics. It is shown using published studies that these systems approaches are valuable and powerful compared to stand-alone genomic methods in identifying key causal and highly predictive genetic variants for complex traits as well as in building up complex genetic regulatory networks. In all sections, some applications of next generation/-omics methods in livestock species (e.g. feed efficiency, growth, weight gain, fertility and disease resistance in cattle, pigs and sheep) are provided with references to relevant software and tools. In conclusion, this paper reviewed the current progress, lessons and challenges in livestock genomics and its ongoing transition to and opportunities for integrative systems genetics and systems biology in animal and veterinary sciences. Most of these integrative systems genetics and systems biology tools and methods presented here are equally applicable to plant and human genetics and systems biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There are many algorithms for detecting epistatic interactions in GWAS. However, most of these algorithms are applicable only for detecting two-locus interactions. Some algorithms are designed to detect only two-locus interactions from the beginning. Others do not have limits to the order of interactions, but in practice take very long time to detect higher order interactions in real data of GWAS. Even the better ones take days to detect higher order interactions in \{WTCCC\} data. We propose a fast algorithm for detection of high order epistatic interactions in GWAS. It runs k-means clustering algorithm on the set of all SNPs. Then candidates are selected from each cluster. These candidates are examined to find the causative \{SNPs\} of k-locus interactions. We use mutual information from information theory as the measure of association between genotypes and phenotypes. We tested the power and speed of our method on extensive sets of simulated data. The results show that our method has more or equal power, and runs much faster than previously reported methods. We also applied our algorithm on each of seven diseases in \{WTCCC\} data to analyze up to 5-locus interactions. It takes only a few hours to analyze 5-locus interactions in one dataset. From the results we make some interesting and meaningful observations on each disease in \{WTCCC\} data. In this study, a simple yet powerful two-step approach is proposed for fast detection of high order epistatic interaction. Our algorithm makes it possible to detect high order epistatic interactions in \{GWAS\} in a matter of hours on a PC.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting and visualizing nonlinear interactive effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) or epistatic interactions are important topics of signal processing having great mathematical and computational challenges. To address these problems, a three-stage method, epiMiner (epistasis Miner), is proposed based on co-information theory. In screening stage, Co-Information Index (CII) is employed to visualize and rank contributions of individual SNPs to the phenotype, with the number of top ranking SNPs retained to next stage specified by users directly or a support vector machine classifier automatically. In testing stage, co-information and co-information based permutation test are conducted sequentially to search epistatic interactions within the retained SNPs, with the results then ranked by their p-values. For further characterizing broader epistasis landscape, a visualizing stage is designed to dynamically construct epistasis networks by linking pairs of the retained SNPs if their co-information values with respect to the phenotype are stronger than thresholds. The performance of epiMiner is compared with existing methods on a diverse range of simulated data sets containing several epistasis models. Results demonstrate that epiMiner is effective in detecting and visualizing epistatic interactions. In addition, the application of epiMiner on a real Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) data set provides several new clues for the exploration of causative factors of AMD. The Matlab version of epiMiner software is available free online at https://sourceforge.net/projects/epiminer/files/.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Identifying variants associated with complex human traits in high-dimensional data is a central goal of genome-wide association studies. However, complicated etiologies such as gene-gene interactions are ignored by the univariate analysis usually applied in these studies. Random Forests (RF) are a popular data-mining technique that can accommodate a large number of predictor variables and allow for complex models with interactions. RF analysis produces measures of variable importance that can be used to rank the predictor variables. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using RFs is gaining popularity as a potential filter approach that considers interactions in high-dimensional data. However, the impact of data dimensionality on the power of RF to identify interactions has not been thoroughly explored. We investigate the ability of rankings from variable importance measures to detect gene-gene interaction effects and their potential effectiveness as filters compared to p-values from univariate logistic regression, particularly as the data becomes increasingly high-dimensional.RESULTS:RF effectively identifies interactions in low dimensional data. As the total number of predictor variables increases, probability of detection declines more rapidly for interacting SNPs than for non-interacting SNPs, indicating that in high-dimensional data the RF variable importance measures are capturing marginal effects rather than capturing the effects of interactions.CONCLUSIONS:While RF remains a promising data-mining technique that extends univariate methods to condition on multiple variables simultaneously, RF variable importance measures fail to detect interaction effects in high-dimensional data in the absence of a strong marginal component, and therefore may not be useful as a filter technique that allows for interaction effects in genome-wide data.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:It has now become clear that gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions are ubiquitous and fundamental mechanisms for the development of complex diseases. Though a considerable effort has been put into developing statistical models and algorithmic strategies for identifying such interactions, the accurate identification of those genetic interactions has been proven to be very challenging.METHODS:In this paper, we propose a new approach for identifying such gene-gene and gene-environment interactions underlying complex diseases. This is a hybrid algorithm and it combines genetic algorithm (GA) and an ensemble of classifiers (called genetic ensemble). Using this approach, the original problem of SNP interaction identification is converted into a data mining problem of combinatorial feature selection. By collecting various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) subsets as well as environmental factors generated in multiple GA runs, patterns of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions can be extracted using a simple combinatorial ranking method. Also considered in this study is the idea of combining identification results obtained from multiple algorithms. A novel formula based on pairwise double fault is designed to quantify the degree of complementarity.CONCLUSIONS:Our simulation study demonstrates that the proposed genetic ensemble algorithm has comparable identification power to Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) and is slightly better than Polymorphism Interaction Analysis (PIA), which are the two most popular methods for gene-gene interaction identification. More importantly, the identification results generated by using our genetic ensemble algorithm are highly complementary to those obtained by PIA and MDR. Experimental results from our simulation studies and real world data application also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed genetic ensemble algorithm, as well as the potential benefits of combining identification results from different algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Feed efficiency is an economically important trait in the beef and dairy cattle industries. Residual feed intake (RFI) is a measure of partial efficiency that is independent of production level per unit of body weight. The objective of this study was to identify significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and RFI in dairy cattle using the Random Forests (RF) algorithm. Genomic data included 42,275 SNP genotypes for 395 Holstein cows, whereas phenotypic measurements were daily RFI from 50 to 150 d postpartum. Residual feed intake was defined as the difference between an animal’s feed intake and the average intake of its cohort, after adjustment for year and season of calving, year and season of measurement, age at calving nested within parity, days in milk, milk yield, body weight, and body weight change. Random Forests is a widely used machine-learning algorithm that has been applied to classification and regression problems. By analyzing the tree structures produced within RF, the 25 most frequent pairwise SNP interactions were reported as possible epistatic interactions. The importance scores that are generated by RF take into account both main effects of variables and interactions between variables, and the most negative value of all importance scores can be used as the cutoff level for declaring SNP effects as significant. Ranking by importance scores, 188 SNP surpassed the threshold, among which 38 SNP were mapped to RFI quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions reported in a previous study in beef cattle, and 2 SNP were also detected by a genome-wide association study in beef cattle. The ratio of number of SNP located in RFI QTL to the total number of SNP in the top 188 SNP chosen by RF was significantly higher than in all 42,275 whole-genome markers. Pathway analysis indicated that many of the top 188 SNP are in genomic regions that contain annotated genes with biological functions that may influence RFI. Frequently occurring ancestor-descendant SNP pairs can be explored as possible epistatic effects for further study. The importance scores generated by RF can be used effectively to identify large additive or epistatic SNP and informative QTL. The consistency in results of our study and previous studies in beef cattle indicates that the genetic architecture of RFI in dairy cattle might be similar to that of beef cattle.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the growing consensus on the importance of testing gene-gene interactions in genetic studies of complex diseases, the effect of gene-gene interactions has often been defined as a deviance from genetic additive effects, which is essentially treated as a residual term in genetic analysis and leads to low power in detecting the presence of interacting effects. To what extent the definition of gene-gene interaction at population level reflects the genes' biochemical or physiological interaction remains a mystery. In this article, we introduce a novel definition and a new measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci (or genes). We developed a general theory for studying linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in disease population under two-locus disease models. The properties of using the \{LD\} measure in a disease population as a function of the measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci were also investigated. We examined how interaction between two loci creates \{LD\} in a disease population and showed that the mathematical formulation of the new definition for gene-gene interaction between two loci was similar to that of the \{LD\} between two loci. This finding motived us to develop an LD-based statistic to detect gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci. The null distribution and type I error rates of the LD-based statistic for testing gene-gene interaction were validated using extensive simulation studies. We found that the new test statistic was more powerful than the traditional logistic regression under three two-locus disease models and demonstrated that the power of the test statistic depends on the measure of gene-gene interaction. We also investigated the impact of using tagging \{SNPs\} for testing interaction on the power to detect interaction between two unlinked loci. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our new method, we applied the LD-based statistic to two published data sets. Our results showed that the P values of the LD-based statistic were smaller than those obtained by other approaches, including logistic regression models.},
