	The purpose of this book is two-fold: to present some new results
	of fuzzy set theory and to offer a systematic treatment of applications
	of fuzzy methods in a reliability area. Primarily it presents a new
	definition of conditional possibility and discusses various properties
	of conditional possibility. Further, this book proposes an existence
	theorem of possibility space in possibility theory. Secondly, the
	book discusses the following: reliability analysis in onventional
	reliability theory while reliability (probability) is treated as
	a fuzzy number, noting that the conventional reliability theory is
	based on the robability assumption and the binary-state assumption;
	profust reliability heory, which is based on the probability assumption
	and the fuzzy-state ssumption; posbist reliability theory, which
	is based on the possibility ssumption and the binary-state assumption;
	fuzzy software reliability odeling.},

	abstract = {In order to validate objective indirect measures of software attributes,
	it is vital to demonstrate sufficiency of the representation condition.
	However, when a direct measurement on an ordinal scale is undertaken
	by human-raters, a significant degree of subjectivity may exist.
	Consequently, demonstrating that an objective indirect measure represents
	the attribute is difficult. It is difficult because subjectivity
	during direct measurement will lead to miss-classification. Further,
	during a demonstration the objective indirect measure itself cannot
	be assumed to give the `true' measurement values. Modular cohesion
	is an attribute measured on an ordinal scale that exhibits subjectivity
	during direct measurement. By reference to cohesion classification
	data {B}ayesian inference probability distributions are constructed
	that represent error due to subjectivity during direct measurement.
	Using these probability distributions, an approach to demonstrate
	sufficiency of the representation condition for an objective indirect
	measure is proffered. In addition, {B}ayesian probability distributions
	can be used to provide informative estimates of the predictive capability
	of prediction systems for subjective attributes.},
