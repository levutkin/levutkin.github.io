	abstract = {In the context of vision-based hand gesture recognition, we study
	how a robot swarm can incrementally and cooperatively learn to classify
	an unseen gesture vocabulary using a simple information sharing mechanism.
	Training examples and correction feedback are interactively provided
	by a human instructor. Each robot in the swarm is equipped with a
	statistical classifier, which is built and progressively updated
	using the input from the instructor. In order to learn collectively
	and speed-up the process, the robots share with each other a selection
	of the locally acquired gesture data. Extensive experiments on a
	real-world dataset show that the proposed cooperative learning approach
	is effective and robust, in spite of its simplicity. Accounting for
	bandwidth limitations in network communications, we study the impact
	of different strategies for the selection of the shared data, and
	we investigate the effect of swarm size and the amount of shared
	information on the learning speed.},

	abstract = {Integrating information coming from different sensors is a fundamental
	capability for autonomous robots. For complex tasks like topological
	localization, it would be desirable to use multiple cues, possibly
	from different modalities, so to achieve robust performance. This
	paper proposes a new method for integrating multiple cues. For each
	cue we train a large margin classifier which outputs a set of scores
	indicating the confidence of the decision. These scores are then
	used as input to a support vector machine, that learns how to weight
	each cue, for each class, optimally during training. We call this
	algorithm SVM-based discriminative accumulation scheme (SVM-DAS).
	We applied our method to the topological localization task, using
	vision and laser-based cues. Experimental results clearly show the
	value of our approach.},

	studied problem in robotics. However, the classical methods may fail
	to take into account the measurements validity, therefore ruining
	the benefits of sensor redundancy. This work addresses this problem
	by learning context-dependent knowledge about sensor reliability.
	This knowledge is later used as a decision rule in the fusion task
	in order to dynamically select the most appropriate subset of sensors.
	For this purpose we use the Mixture of Experts framework. In our
	application, each expert is a Kalman filter fed by a subset of sensors,
	and a gating network serves as a mediator between individual filters,
	basing its decision on sensor inputs and contextual information to
	reason about the operation context. The performance of this model
	is evaluated for altitude estimation of a UAV.},

	photos captured in uncontrollable conditions. In recent years, Convolutional
	Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated its effectiveness for various

	mainstream CNNs based models addressing image retrieval tasks: triplet

	and investigate the impact of different domain adaptation schemes
	including parameter sharing, non-sharing, and a new partial-sharing
	strategy between the street domain and the shop domain. Extensive
	experiments have revealed that the proposed partial-sharing scheme
	is able to reduce the number of parameters by a significant margin,
	while achieving comparable retrieval accuracy as the state-of-the-art

	We provide a review of the literature for other training methods,

	learning of ME in detail. In addition, we describe the model selection
	literature which encompasses finding the optimum number of experts,
	as well as the depth of the tree. We present the advances in ME in
	the classification area and present some issues concerning the classification
	model. We list the statistical properties of ME, discuss how the
	model has been modified over the years, compare ME to some popular
	algorithms, and list several applications. We conclude our survey
	with future directions and provide a list of publicly available datasets
	and a list of publicly available software that implement ME. Finally,
