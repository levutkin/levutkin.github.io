@article{Goodman-Nguyen99,
	abstract = {The second order probability technique is a procedure whereby an incompletely
    specified (finite-argument) probability function is modeled as a random vector
    over the associated natural simplex of all possible probability functions of
    a fixed common number of arguments. Often, the distribution of the random vector
    is assumed to be a uniform one, as in the case of Goodman's treatment of the
    probabilistic syllogism (or penguin triangle) problem (1998). But, when compatibility
    with a non-uniform prior distribution is sought, the uniform random vector
    assumption must be replaced by a different one. In a related, but distinct
    direction, conditional event algebra is a new mathematical tool which allows
    the direct incorporation of conditional relations expressed through conditional
    probabilities with other such conditional relations or unconditional events
    [I.R. Goodman, H.T. Nguyen, Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness, and Knowledge-Based
    Systems 3 (3) (1995) 247�339; I.R. Goodman, R.P. Mahler, H.T. Nguyen, Mathematics
    of Data Fusion, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Holland, 1997]. The
    "Judy Benjamin" (JB) problem, as originally posed by Van Fraasen [British Journal
    of Philosophy of Science 32 (1981) 375�379], has been recently addressed by
    Grove and Halpern (G{\&}H) [Proceedings of the 13th Conference Uncertainty
    in AI,1997, pp. 208�214], and has elements in it conducive to analysis via
    both second order probability and conditional event algebra: The problem involves
    the issue of how to update a particular event of interest having a known prior
    probability � part of a known uniform prior probability function � upon a known
    conditional probability statement � when the latter is given through a probability
    function otherwise unknown and distinct from the prior probability function.
    In the problem as stated, the event of interest is disjoint from the antecedent
    event in the conditional probability statement. G{\&}H make use of a trust
    principle in order to be able to apply, in effect, the second order probability
    technique with an associated uniform distribution. G{\&}H's result differs
    sharply from that of Van Fraasen, who employs instead a minimal cross-entropy
    approach to the problem, in that G{\&}H show no change in probability values
    between the prior and posterior assessments. This paper considers in a more
    general context the application of the second order probability technique,
    using the Dirichlet family generalization of the uniform distribution over
    a simplex, in updating an event upon a conditional probability statement when
    no such disjointness as in the JB problem holds and compatibility is sought
    with a non-uniform prior. When this is specialized to the disjoint event case,
    even with a non-uniform prior, the independence result of G{\&}H extends to
    this context. The JB problem is also considered via a conditional event algebra
    viewpoint which avoids the trust principle � in conjunction with the second
    order probability technique and general agreement with that of G{\&}H's independence
    result is established for the case of disjoint event of interest from the antecedent
    (and consequence) of the conditional form. These relations are also extended
    to a more general setting.},

	abstract = {In practical applications of stochastic programming the involved probability
    distributions are never known exactly. One can try to hedge against the worst
    expected value resulting from a considered set of permissible distributions.
    This leads to a min-max formulation of the corresponding stochastic programming
    problem. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, such a min-max problem
    generates a probability distribution on the set of permissible distributions
    with the min-max problem being equivalent to the expected value problem with
    respect to the corresponding weighted distribution. We consider examples of
    the news vendor problem, the problem of moments and problems involving unimodal
    distributions. Finally, we discuss the Monte Carlo sample average approach
    to solving such min-max problems.},
