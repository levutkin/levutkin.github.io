  abstract = {Missing data is a common drawback in many real-life pattern classification
	scenarios. One of the most popular solutions is missing data imputation
	by the K nearest neighbours ( K NN ) algorithm. In this article,
	we propose a novel K NN imputation procedure using a feature-weighted
	distance metric based on mutual information (MI). This method provides
	a missing data estimation aimed at solving the classification task,
	i.e., it provides an imputed dataset which is directed toward improving
	the classification performance. The MI-based distance metric is also
	used to implement an effective K NN classifier. Experimental results
	on both artificial and real classification datasets are provided
	to illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.}
